## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cdp-chatbot.git
cd cdp-chatbot


2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:

env
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key
4. Ensure Documentation Files
Place the documentation files for each CDP in the data folder:

segment-docs.txt
mparticle-docs.txt
lytics-docs.txt
zeotap-docs.txt
Ensure they are in plain text format and contain the relevant documentation.

5. Start the Server
For development, use nodemon to auto-restart on file changes:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Alternatively, start the server directly:

bash
Copy code
npm start
6. Access the Chatbot
Open your browser and navigate to:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:3000
Project Structure
The project follows a modular structure:

bash

Testing
1. Cross-CDP Comparisons
Example Question:

"How does Segment's audience creation process compare to Lytics'?" Expected Behavior:
The chatbot highlights similarities and differences between the two platforms.
2. Advanced "How-to" Questions
Example Question:

"How do I configure real-time triggers in mParticle for user updates?" Expected Behavior:
The chatbot provides step-by-step guidance for setting up real-time triggers.
Troubleshooting
Error: "Sorry, there was an error processing your request"
Cause: API issues, network problems, or SSL errors.
Solution:
Check the API key in your .env file.
Ensure network connectivity to OpenAI's API.
If SSL issues persist, configure the httpsAgent in chatbot.js to bypass SSL validation (for development only).
Missing Files
Ensure that public/index.html and all data/*.txt files are present.
Future Enhancements
Add support for multi-language queries.
Implement caching to reduce API calls.
Enhance error messages for better user feedback.
